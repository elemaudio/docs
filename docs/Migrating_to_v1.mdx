# Migrating to v1.0

The path from v0.11.x to v1.0.0 brought about a small set of breaking changes that were necessary
for the stabilization of the Elementary core API. Here we enumerate each breaking change and provide
suggestions for updating your code.

<TOCInline toc={toc} />

## Distinct Renderer Packages

Before v1.0, Elementary shipped only an `@elemaudio/core` and `@elemaudio/core-lite` package, each of which
provided the supported renderers in their exports. This was convenient initially, but became an issue which
yielded package bloat, increased complexity when trying to update one renderer in isolation, and encouraged coupling.

As of v1.0 each renderer is available in its own package, as detailed in the Packages section on the sidebar.

```js
// Old:
import {el, ElementaryPluginRenderer} from '@elemaudio/core';

// New:
import {el} from '@elemaudio/core';
import PluginRenderer from '@elemaudio/plugin-renderer';

// Or:
import {el} from '@elemaudio/core';
import {default as core} from '@elemaudio/plugin-renderer';
```

You'll notice as well that the `@elemaudio/web-renderer` and `@elemaudio/offline-renderer` packages no longer
export singleton renderer instances, they now export class constructors, allowing multiple instances running in
parallel. This pattern is one we aim to gradually adopt in the Node.js renderer and Plugin renderer in future updates.

```js
// Old:
import {ElementaryWebAudioRenderer as core} from '@elemaudio/core';

core.initialize(...);
core.render(...);

// New:
import WebRenderer from '@elemaudio/web-renderer';

let core = new WebRenderer();

core.initialize(...);
core.render(...);
```

## Explicit trailing arguments

As part of the move to support strong TypeScript definitions on the core library functions, the following nodes were
changed to now explicitly require all trailing arguments in their invocations.

* `el.sample`
* `el.seq`
* `el.seq2`
* `el.phasor`

In each of these cases, the last argument is for reset behavior. If you still don't need reset behavior, you can
simply place a constant value 0 in the argument array.

```js
// Old:
el.phasor(440);
el.seq({seq: [1, 2, 3]}, el.train(1));

// New:
el.phasor(440, 0);
el.seq({seq: [1, 2, 3]}, el.train(1), 0);
```

## Removed the explicit `memo` API

Before v1.0, memoization for composite nodes required an explicit wrapper. This API has been removed as it is
no longer needed; memoization for composite nodes now happens automatically. See [Understanding Memoization](./guides/Understanding_Memoization)
for details.

## Removed the sugar API

Similar to the above change, the "sugar" API of v0.11.x has been removed in favor of a more clear and consistent API.
In almost all cases, the sugar API was only relevant for composite nodes in the first place. Now that the composite node API
and memoization have changed, this API is much less helpful. See [Understanding Memoization](./guides/Understanding_Memoization) for
more details.

## Removed `el.freeverb`

In an effort to consolidate the core library around a better standard for the library API, `el.freeverb` has been removed. The original
library code is available [here on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/nick-thompson/0473449fbbfd92776d19e28961738d28) and you're invited to
use it freely in your own applications. When using this algorithm you're strongly encouraged to think about keys and memoization and how
you can standardize the Freeverb API within the context of your own app.
