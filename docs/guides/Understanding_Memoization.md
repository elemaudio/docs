# Understanding Memoization

TODO

* "In Depth" -> big graphs -> reconcile to find a single prop update? Waste.
* Memoization -> allows considering entire subgraphs only when necessary, yields much smaller/faster reconciliation passes
* Composite nodes and `createNode`
* Identifying memo hits and misses
* memoKey for speedups
