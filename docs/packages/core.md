# @elemaudio/core

The official Elementary Audio core package; this package provides the standard library for composing
audio processing nodes, as well as utilities for constructing and addressing composite nodes. This package
also provides a set of core algorithms which can be used to build your own rendering utilities for custom
integrations.

## Installation

```js
npm install --save @elemaudio/core
```

## Usage

```js
import {
  el,
  createNode,
  isNode,
  resolve,
  Renderer,
} from '@elemaudio/core';
```

### el

A plain object through which you can access all of the available standard library nodes. For
documentation on exactly which nodes are available and what they do, see the [Core Library Reference](../LibraryIndex.md).

### createNode

```js
function createNode(kind: string | Function, props: Object, children: array<NodeRepr_t | number>): NodeRepr_t;
```

A factory function for creating an audio node, `NodeRepr_t`. Every function available on `el` ultimately decays
to a series of calls to `createNode`.

Typically, you'll only need to pay attention to this API for creating "Composite" nodes, which we discuss in
[Understanding Memoization](../guides/Understanding_Memoization.md). In that case, you'll pass a function to `createNode`
along with a set of props and children with which your function will be invoked during the render process.

```js
// An example composite node which composes over two series filters
function myFilterComposite({props, children}) {
  return el.lowpass(
    props.cutoff,
    0.707,
    el.peak(props.cutoff / 2, 0.707, children[0])
  );
}

// A helper function which feels similar to the `el.*` functions which hides away
// the explicit call to `createNode`.
function myFilter(props, input) {
  return createNode(myFilterComposite, props, input);
}
```

### isNode

```js
function isNode(a: any): bool;
```

A simple utility for identifying if the input argument is of type `NodeRepr_t`. You'll rarely need this,
but it's worth noting especially for TypeScript users that some of the `el.*` library functions have
a return type of `NodeRepr_t | number`, and you may find utility in `isNode` in those scenarios.


### resolve

```js
function resolve(n: NodeRepr_t | number): NodeRepr_t;
```

Very similar to the above `isNode`; this utility accepts an input which is either a `NodeRepr_t` or a `number`
and resolves to a `NodeRepr_t`. Again, you'll rarely need it but perhaps for cases where the `el.*` library
functions yield a `NodeRepr_t | number` type.

### Renderer

The `Renderer` class is a generic utility for performing the graph rendering and reconciliation step. Both the
`offline-renderer` and the `web-renderer` are small proxies to distinct `Renderer` instances. This API is provided
for you to write your own Renderers depending on your app integration.

Using the generic Renderer requires just the constructor, and handling some message passing:

```js
const core = new Renderer(sampleRate, (instructionBatch) => {
  // Send the instruction batch to your `elem::Runtime<FloatType>` instance, wherever that may be!
  // Perhaps this is a websocket send step, or perhaps calling a FFI interface in your JavaScript runtime,
  // or even just saving to file to perform snapshot regression testing like with Jest.
});
```

Afterwards, you can use the `render()` API just like you would expect with any other renderer:

```js
core.render(el.cycle(440), el.cycle(441));
```

The web-renderer and offline-renderer both follow this pattern, and simply wrap the above API into a larger
object which adds additional utility like event emitting and APIs which forward directly to the runtime.
